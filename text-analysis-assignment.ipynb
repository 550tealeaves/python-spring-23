    "For this text analysis assignment, you will choose between the following possibilities\n",
    "1. Text analysis of **gender** from texts in nltk.book.\n",
    "2. Text analysis of **monsters** from texts in nltk.book\n",
    "3. Text analysis of a topic of your choosing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose **genders**, do the following:\n",
    "- Load up nltk.book. Choose one text by a man and one text by a woman.\n",
    "- Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.\n",
    "- Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:\n",
    "    - `similar()`, `concordance()`, `distribution_plot([])`, `collocations()`, and `common_contexts([])`\n",
    "    - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` \n",
    "- Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:\n",
    "   - What did you discover about the way gender is portrayed across the two texts? \n",
    "   - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose **monsters**, do the following:\n",
    "- Load up nltk.book. Select two texts, *Dracula* and *Frankenstein*.\n",
    "- Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.\n",
    "- Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:\n",

    "   \n",
    "If you choose to do your own topic, follow the above process for cleaning and analysis. Then, write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, answering the following questions:\n",
    "   - What did you discover about your topic? What patterns emerged from the analysis? \n",
    "   - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?"
